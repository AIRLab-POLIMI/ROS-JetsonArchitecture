Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopment conditions that
involve aspects of social and communication skills. Each single case is characterized by different persistent challenges that the subject has to face every
day. Studies suggest that children affected by ASD exhibit positive social
behaviors while interacting with robots that are not observed while interacting in other contexts, such as sessions with therapists or caregivers. Under
this light Social Assistive Robots (SAR), robots designed to help humans
thought social interactions, when used under these circumstances should
be user-adjustable, in order to match childâ€™s own unique challenges, and
they should offer a certain degree of autonomy to allow multiple kind of
interactions among the therapist, the subject and the robot itself.
The aim of this work is to provide a modular architecture to allow the execution of activities, established through a script-like language, combined with
"on-the-fly" adaptation of them via rule triggering and joystick-based human
intervention.
